                        <p class="news-info">Beneath exhilarating rollercoaster rides and silly conversations with squirrels, It Takes Two has a heavy heart. It’s about divorce and the toll taken on a daughter who doesn’t want to lose her family. It’s about decaying love and the differences that divide us. It’s about not wanting to face reality and not wanting to let go. It’s also about hope and uncertainty, the past creating a better future, and finding common ground no matter how much it may hurt. All of these elements are beautifully woven into a colorful and soulful adventure that hits hard, both in its moving narrative and clever gameplay. It Takes Two succeeds in being a game that pushes two individuals to work together to create a relationship that works, but for how long?...</p>

                        <p class="news-info">A Way Out does some truly incredible things with co-operative game design. Taking splitscreen play and injecting it with fresh ideas, wonderful cinematic camera work and creating something that’s truly built with two players in mind, it’s incredibly intuitive.Unfortunately, an unconvincing narrative, poor voice acting and inconsistent visuals don’t quite live up to these foundations. A Way Out’s mechanical concepts will live far longer in the memory than its artistic choices...</p>

Maybe these weren't the questions you expected from Nier: Automata, a game that - on the surface at least - is about a sexy robot fighting other robots with swords and a talking laser turret. But that sort of philosophical existentialism is exactly what you'll get if you play, along with a healthy dose of awe-inspiring martial acrobatics and swordplay, courtesy of developer Platinum Games...</p>

                        <p class="news-info">It takes a brave developer to entirely change the formula of a long-running, highly successful series. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” rings true for many franchises. To change the fundamentals of a series risks upsetting a fanbase that may have been around for, at times, decades. For Sony Santa Monica to change the very fabric of God of War is a phenomenal gamble – but one that, for the most part, pays off. God of War is superb, offering a stunningly detailed and lush world built with a level of detail that makes it wondrous to explore. It also has room to breath, allowing Kratos and Atreus’ roller-coaster relationship to build into something that can almost rival The Last of Us’ Ellie and Joel. While a lot has changed for God of War, it still holds one of the most satisfying and entertaining combat systems in gaming...</p>
